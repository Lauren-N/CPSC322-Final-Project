    "    * Because there are so many attributes, deciding to use a subset of them or all of them\n",
    "        * To pare down the attributes, we could randomly select different subsets and compare the model performances to select the \"best\" attributes\n",
    "        * However, we instead will likely use unsupervised learning to graph the attributes in comparison to the classifier attribute and determine which attributes have the strongest correlations and use those\n",
    "    * Discretizing our dataset could be a challenge because there are many attributes with float values that are quite specific (lots of decimal places)\n",
    "        * For example some of these attributes are: PhysicalActivity (0-10, but float long decimals), DietQuality (0-10, but float long decimals), SleepQuality (4-10, but float long decimals), and others\n",
